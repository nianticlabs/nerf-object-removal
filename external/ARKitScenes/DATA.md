# Data download
This section will guide you on how to download the datasets, and explain about each file format exist in the datasets.

## datasets
ARKitScenes includes 3 datasets, 
1. `3dod` - The dataset used to train 3d object detection. The dataset includes 3 assets: low resolution RGB image, low resolution depth image and the labels (The total Size is 623.4 GB for 5047 threedod scans)
2. `upsampling` - The dataset used to train depth upsampling. The dataset includes 3 assets: high resolution RGB image, low resolution depth image and high resolution depth image
3. `raw` - This dataset includes all data available in ARKitScenes, the 3dod and depth upsampling datasets are a subset of it,
the dataset includes much more assets that are not part of 3DOD or depth upsampling.


## Downloading data
Each dataset has a CSV file that includes all the `visit_id`, `video_id` and `fold` available in the dataset.

3DOD CSV path:
```
ARKitScenes/threedod/3dod_train_val_splits.csv
```
Upsampling CSV path:
```
ARKitScenes/depth_upsampling/upsampling_train_val_splits.csv
```
Upsampling CSV path:
```
ARKitScenes/raw/raw_train_val_splits.csv
```

To download each one of the datasets, we added a python script - `download_data.py`.

To download a specific video_id or series of video_ids, `download_data.py` expect the first argument to be the dataset name (i.e. 3dod/upsampling/raw)
the second argument the fold (i.e. Training/Validation) and video_id or series of video_ids.

```shell script
python3 download_data.py [3dod/upsampling/raw] --split [Training/Validation] --video_id video_id1 video_id2 \
--download_dir YOUR_DATA_FOLDER
```
for example
```shell script
python3 download_data.py raw --split Training --video_id 41048190 \
--download_dir /tmp/ARKitScenes/
```

To download with CSV, `download_data.py` expect the first argument to be a dataset name (i.e. 3dod/upsampling/raw), 
and no need for the fold, because the fold information exist in the CSV file.  
```shell script
python3 download_data.py [3dod/upsampling/raw] --video_id_csv CSV_PATH \
--download_dir YOUR_DATA_FOLDER
```
for example
```shell script
python3 download_data.py 3dod --video_id_csv threedod/3dod_train_val_splits.csv \
--download_dir /tmp/raw_ARKitScenes/
```

The data folder (i.e. `YOUR_DATA_DIR`) will includes two directories, `Training` and `Validation` which includes all the assets
belonging to training and validation bin respectively.

## Dataset files formats
The dataset includes the following formats
1. `.png` - store RGB images, depth images and confidence images
    - `RGB images` - regular `uint8`, 3 channel image
    - `depth image` - `uint16` png format in millimeters
    - `confidence` - `uint8` png format `0`-low confidence `2`-high confidence
2. `.pincam` - store the intrinsic matrix for each RGB image
    - is a single-line text file, space-delimited, with the following fields: 
    `width` `height` `focal_length_x` `focal_length_y` `principal_point_x` `principal_point_y` 
3. `.json` - store the object annotation 
4. `.traj` -  is a space-delimited file where each line represents a camera position at a particular timestamp.
    - Column 1: timestamp
    - Columns 2-4: rotation (axis-angle representation in radians)
    - Columns 5-7: translation (in meters)
5. `.ply` - store the mesh generated by ARkit
6. `.mov` - video captured with ARKit (raw dataset only)
